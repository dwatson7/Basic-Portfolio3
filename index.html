  <div id= "HiThere">
  <div id="P1"> Well hi there. My name is Daniel Watson, but my cowokers call me "Dwats" for short. I'm big into giving back to the community and making sure that our future kids doesn't have to overcome any walls/ barriers that may be ahead of them (no pun intended).</p>

  <div id="P2"> I'm big into sports and I love to travel when my work allows me to do so. I'd have to say my greatest traveling experience was in St.Kitts and Nevis, maybe becasue my father side of my family is from there so it felt like home in a sense. I believe that I obtained my liking for computers from him, but it's sad to say that I am just now testing out those skills. I come from a great family of 5 siblings, I like to call us the black brady bunch, and I happen to be the youngest unfortunately. By the time this class ends I'm looking forward to building websites from the bottom up!</p>
